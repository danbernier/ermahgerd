# ERMAHGERD, RUBY GERMS, MAH FRAVRIT!

It had to be done.

Ermahgerd is a ruby gem to translate your text from English into
Ermahgerd-lish, based heavily (so far exclusively) on the [ERMAHGERD
TRANSLATOR](http://ermahgerd.jmillerdesign.com) by J Miller Design.

# Installation

@gem install ermahgerd@

# Usage

```ruby
require 'ermahgerd'
Ermahgerd.translate("Goosebumps!")  #=> "GERSBERMS!"
```
